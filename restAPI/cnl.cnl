A time is a temporal concept expressed in steps ranging from 1 to 10.
A joint is identified by an id.
An angle is identified by a value.
A position is identified by a joint, by an angle, and by a time.
A link is identified by a first joint, and by a second joint.
A rotation is identified by a first joint, by a second joint, by a desired angle, by a current angle, and by a time.
A goal is identified by a joint, and by an angle.
granularity is a constant equal to 90.
timemax is a constant equal to 90.
It is required that the first joint J1 of the rotation R is greater than the second joint J2 of the rotation R, whenever there is a rotation R with first joint J1, with second joint J2.
